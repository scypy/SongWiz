Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time!I apologize, even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna Just gonna stand there and watch me burn? Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry? Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie",82,Recovery,18/06/2010,latin,263373,en,0.516061,0.67669,0.721977,0.629621,,,

It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots! Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!) Feminist women love Eminem ""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose ""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes— I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope) Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!You think I give a damn about a Grammy? Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears? Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first Little bitch put me on blast on MTV ""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""I should download her audio on MP3 And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!) I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all I just get on the mic and spit it And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it Better than 90% of you rappers out can Then you wonder: ""How can Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""It's funny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30 I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!"" With his windows down and his system up So will the real Shady please stand up And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?
